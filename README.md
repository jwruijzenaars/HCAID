# HCAID

## TO DO:

- Make Bad website bad
  - Expand register page with data that's not needed for the predictions, and log everything in the console (privacy)
  - Do other stuff

- Check what features we actually want to predict on:

  - Pick game then show games to play based on the genres/tags.
  - Pick genres/tags then show games to play based off of those ('evil': show most expensive games, or games from certain dev or publisher are heavily biased).
  - Pick one of these and add option to choose min/max rating ratio (can be 'evil' too).

- Add model
- Make pretty.
- Add my account page (if we have time).
- Possibility to save predictions?
